This folder contains work in progress files (raw hanzi files or otherwise not yet finished hanzi), so that contributors don't start to work on the same characters.

Raw files (that is files created from the template.svg and saved from the SVG editor of choice, but not yet converted to the final format via format.html) should be marked with the extension .raw.svg
